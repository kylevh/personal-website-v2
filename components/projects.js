        title: 'College Affordability Backend Testing Tool - Capstone Project',
        desc: 'A web app designed to streamline the testing process and enable developers to easily execute test scripts and oversee file management efficiently',
        pageDesc: `The College Affordability Application is an ongoing project that aims to help Washington State policy makers and prospective college students estimate the cost of attendance and financial aid they are eligible for based on their chosen college. The tool draws data from a variety of sources and factors in an individualâs financial situation and potential aid to provide a comprehensive estimate of the total cost of attendance based on these parameters.

        The application necessitates comprehensive testing, a process that is currently time-consuming for end-users to complete. Conducting tests to the backend presents a challenge for developers who lack familiarity with the tech stack. This learning curve significantly extends the time required for tasks that should otherwise be straightforward, leading to inefficiencies.
        
        During the course of the project, I worked in a full stack capacity. I created a user-friendly website dedicated to executing test scripts using the Django Python web framework and CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to tackle the problem. This solution replaced the inefficient and cumbersome task of manually entering console commands and reviewing files by providing a user-friendly interface that allows end-users to promptly run python scripts. The application also allows for editing, uploading, viewing, and deleting logs and configuration files easily, eliminating the need to directly access the backend.
        
        The result of developing a dedicated website for executing test scripts yielded a significant transformation in the testing process, replacing the manual, time-intensive tasks with a efficient, streamlined interface for developers working on the college affordability application`,
